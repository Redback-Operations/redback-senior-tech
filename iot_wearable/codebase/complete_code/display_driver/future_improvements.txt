Following improvements can be made:

1. User Libraries
Create a library for shapes or other functions to make template creation easier and improve code modularity.
There are currently some shapes procedures in the displaydriver file, this can be used for the library. 
Need to add more parameters such as size.

2. RTC Module implementation
Implement the RTC module in the driver program to enable time tracking.

3. Sensor data
Explore how data from the sensor is going to be received, what the format is etc. 
And develop a way to show actual sensor data to the display.

4. New Templates
Based on what data needs to be presented, (might included data science team's analysis) consider the layout for a new template.
