# Trimester 2 2024 Project 2 - IOT

## Aims for the trimester:  
- Design a new PCB using Altium Designer IDE which is basically a copy of the previous trimester’s PCB but smaller and without any component modules so that everything is directly on the board. The code will be the same. 
- Design a 3D print for the new PCB. 
- Improve the existing code ( see below) 

 

## List of short- and long-term deliverables for 2.1P: 

 - Design a 3D print to cover the batteries on the old 3D case, FreeCAD software. 
 - Improve the code of the current PCB to modify and add: 
 - Fix the touch sensor issue with randomly activating 
 - Use Google firebase instead of ThingSpeak 
 - Make the touch sensor and the display to be more fluid in response rather than rigid and unresponsive to input. 
 - Fix the clock to function properly without any problems. 
 - Fix the display to be more informative for the heart so the code is getting better heart readings. 
 - Decide whether or not to remove the SHOCK! From the display. 
 - Code the display to be more user friendly. 
 - Buy components to add to the existing PCB: 
 - TMP36 and add the appropriate code functionality. 
 - ( 3.3V compatible only ) components to be bought 
 - Design a new PCB using Altium Designer IDE which is basically a copy of the previous trimester’s PCB but smaller and without any component modules so that everything is directly on the board. The code will be the same. 
 - Design a 3D print for the new PCB.
